         the message needs to be publishable.
         (That corresponds to the intuition that everything on the trace 
         is readable by the attacker.)

         So to call this lemma, we have to show `is_publishable tr_enc ping_encrypted`.
         Looking at `DY.Simplified`, we find the lemma `pke_enc_for_is_publishable`,

             In `DY.OnlineS.Invariants` we have the lemma `protocol_invariants_p_has_pki_invariant`
             showing this requirement.

          assert(has_pki_invariant);

             that the serialized ping should be readable by Alice and Bob.
             (Ignore the `long_term_key_label` for now.)

             TODO: they are resolved with the same serialize_wf_lemma
          *)

          (* Finally, we need to show the disjunction of
             * the pke_pred holds for the serialized ping or
             * the serialized ping is publishable

             In our case, the first is true, i.e., the encryption prediate is satisfied.
             The predicate requires that the nonce contained in the ping
             has the label `nonce_label alice' bob'`, where
             * alice' is the name in the first component of the ping and
             * bob' is the participant whos key is used for encryption.

             Since we generate the nonce n_a in the beginning of this step
             with the label `nonce_label alice bob`,
             put the same alice in the first component of the ping
             and use the key of bob for encryption (in pke_enc_for),
             we satisfy the predicate.
          *)

      (* Now we showed all pre-conditions of `pke_enc_for_is_publishable`
         and can call this lemma to show that ping_encrypted is publishable.

         Together with the `send_msg_invariant` lemma, 
         we then obtain that `tr_msg` satisfies the trace invariant.

      (* The last traceful action in this step is starting a new session *)
      let st = SentPing {bob; n_a} in
      let (sid, tr_sess) = start_new_session alice st tr_msg in
      (* `start_new_session` is just calling `new_session_id` and then `set_state`.
         So we have to check that both of those maintain the trace invariant.

         For `new_session_id` we find the lemma 
         `new_session_id_same_trace` in `DY.Core.Trace.Manipulation`
         which says that the trace is not changed.
         Hence it trivially maintains the trace invariant.
         It comes with an SMT pattern, so it is applied automatically.

         In the same file, we have the lemma `set_state_invariant`,
         which gives an additional pre-condition 
         for when the trace after the state was set satisfies the trace invariant.
         This pre-condition is that the new state must satisfy the state predicate.

         The state predicate for the SentPing state requires that
         the nonce stored in the state has the label `nonce_label alice' bob'`, where
         * alice' is the storing principal
         * bob' is the name stored in the first component of the state

         Similarly to above,
         we generated the nonce wit the label `nonce_label alice bob` and
         alice is storing the new state, and
         bob is stored in the first component of the state.
         So the state prediate is satisfied:
      *)
      assert(state_predicate_p.pred tr_msg alice sid st);
      (* With this, we have all pre-conditions of `set_state_invariant`.
         Since that lemma comes with an SMT pattern,
         it is applied automatically.
      *)
      assert(trace_invariant tr_sess)
  )

(* The above proof was very detailed.
   In fact, most of the proof is done automatically by F*
   and we can remove all of the asserts.

   If we just keep the necessary calls to lemmas,
   we end up with the following very short proof.
