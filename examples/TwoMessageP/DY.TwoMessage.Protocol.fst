/// Here we define the DY* model of the
/// simple 2 message protocol:
///
/// A -> B: Ping (A, n_A)
/// B -> A: Ack n_A
///
/// The model consists of 3 functions,
/// one for each action:
/// 1. Alice sends the Ping to Bob (`send_ping`)
/// 2. Bob receives the Ping and replies with the Ack (`receive_ping_and_send_ack`)
/// 3. Alice receives the Ack (`receive_ack`)


(*** Sending the Ping ***)

/// Alice sends the first message to Bob:
/// * Alice generates a new nonce [n_a]
/// * sends the message (Alice, n_a) (intended for Bob)
/// * stores n_a and Bob in a state (in a new session)
/// The step returns the ID of the new state
/// and the timestamp of the message on the trace

  // start a new session with this new state
  let* sid = start_new_session alice ping_state in

  // return the ID of the new session and the timestamp of the message
  return (sid, msg_ts)


(*** Replying to a Ping with an Ack ***)

/// Bob receives the first messages and replies:
/// * read the message (Alice, n_a) from the trace
/// * send the reply (n_a) (intended for Alice)
/// * store n_a and Alice in a state in a new session
/// The step returns the ID of the new state
/// and the timestamp of the reply on the trace.
/// The step fails, if
/// the message is not of the right type, i.e., not a first message.

(*** Receiving an Ack ***)

/// Alice receives the reply from Bob:
/// * read the message (n_a) from the trace
/// * check if Alice previously sent n_a in some session
/// * store completion of this session in a new state
/// Returns the ID of the session that is marked as completed.
/// The step fails, if
/// * the message is not of the right type, i.e., not a reply
/// * there is no prior session related to n_a
