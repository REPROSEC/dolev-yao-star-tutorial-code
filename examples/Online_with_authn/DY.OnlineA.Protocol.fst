/// Here we define the DY* mode of the "Online?" protocol,
/// an extension of the simple Two Message protocol:
/// the two messages are now (asymmetrically) encrypted
///
/// A -> B: enc{Ping (A, n_A)}_B
/// B -> A: enc{Ack n_A}_A
///
/// The model consists of 3 functions,
/// one for each protocol step
/// (just as for the simple two message protocol):
/// 1. Alice sends the Ping to Bob (`send_ping`)
/// 2. Bob receives the Ping and replies with the Ack (`receive_ping_and_send_ack`)
/// 3. Alice receives the Ack (`receive_ack`)
///
/// Additionally, there are two helper functions
/// for steps 2 and 3 (`decode_ping` and `decode_ack`).

(*** Sending the Ping ***)

/// Alice sends the first message to Bob:
/// * Alice generates a new nonce [n_a]
/// * encrypts the message (Alice, n_a) for Bob
/// * sends the encrypted message
/// * stores n_a and Bob in a state (in a new session)
/// The step returns the ID of the new state
/// and the timestamp of the message on the trace
/// The step fails, if
/// encryption was not successful, i.e.,
/// Alice does not have a public key of Bob.
